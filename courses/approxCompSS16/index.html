      <p>
        Approximate computing has emerged recently as a trend at the intersection of
        programming languages, verification and hardware research. It rests on the
        observation that many applications are computing their results more accurately
        than needed, wasting resources in the process.  As an example, the default
        choice for numerical computations is double floating-point precision, but
        often the inputs to those applications come with errors that are much larger
        than the roundoff errors produced by the arithmetic - a smaller precision is
        thus often perfectly sufficient. On the hardware side, we have strived for
        perfect hardware which always produces correct results. Certain applications,
        however, are arguably robust to rare, random errors or noise. These could
        benefit from unreliable hardware and the acompanying energy reductions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of approximate computing is simple: deliberately reduce accuracy to
        save energy, memory and/or time, i.e. view reducing accuracy as an opportunity
        instead of a necessary evil.  Different approximation techniques have emerged
        over the past years, exploring the space of possibilities: unreliable
        hardware, dynamic precision knobs, numerical approximations, loop perforation
        and neural network accelerators among others. One of the key challenges is how
        to make all these available in a principled way to the every-day-programmer
        while ensuring a certain level of necessary correctness.
      </p>
      <p>
        This seminar aims to provide an overview of this fairly new field. It
        also presents a good opportunity to explore a variety of techniques
        from the programming languages, verification and hardware domains applied to
        this specific problem.

      <h2>Organisation</h2>
      <p>
        The current plan is to split the seminar into two parts. In the first part, we will read original research papers; depending on the background of the participants, we will include background sessions where needed. The aim of the second part is to try and explore some of the techniques seen in a hands-on approach and to critically evaluate their effectiveness and promise on real-world applications.

        As the number of spots is limited, we will accept registrations until 19 April and notify you about acceptance by 20 April. Note that there are already more registrations than we can accept.

      <p>Registration is over, but if you wish to participate without credit, just send an email to the instructor.</p>
