      <h2>Seminar Topic</h2>
      <p>
        The idea that we could tell a computer <b>what</b> we want and it would
        automatically figure out <b>how</b> to achieve it has fascinated scientists
        for a long time, but it has also been an elusive goal.

        Via recent research papers in the area of program synthesis, this
        seminar will look at the significant steps which have been made towards
        this grand vision. We will discuss what is currently possible, for which
        application domains program synthesis is successful, what the main
        challenges are and what perhaps will never be feasible. The paper
        selection will cover the major synthesis techniques to provide
        an overview of the current landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Disclaimer</b>: The name 'synthesis' can mean many different things, in particular there
        are two different areas whose goal is to generate programs. This
        course considers the often so-called <em>functional synthesis</em> which
        aims to synthesize programs whose inputs are finite, e.g. a sorting algorithm.
        On the other hand, the input of <em>reactive synthesis</em> generated programs
        are infinite streams, e.g. in embedded controllers.
        <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10009-013-0287-9"
        target="_blank">This introduction</a> nicely explains the differences and also provides
        an introduction to program synthesis.

        The approaches in these two domains are quite different, and in this
        seminar we will focus on <em>functional synthesis</em>.
